# Raw get_next_line

This is my get_next_line just as i made it for the subject, any changes done after de submission -if made- will go in the function get-next-line in [my libft](https://github.com/luna7111/libft).

### Known issue:

The get_next_line_utils_bonus.c includes the wrong library, (includes "get_next_line.h", "not get_next_line_bonus.h") so the moulinette didn't grade the bonus part of the project.
During defense neither i or the evaluators noticed this, which made the final grade be 112%.
